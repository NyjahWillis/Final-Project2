## Intro of Dataset

This data set was obtained through the medicaldata data package. The "Smart Pill" study is a prospective cohort study looking at the first use of a novel motility capsule to compare gastric emptying and small bowel transit times in critically ill trauma patients with intracranial hemorrhage with times recorded previously in healthy volunteers. This study enrolled 8 critically ill patient and the control group consisted of 87 healthy volunteers with no history of major abdominal surgery

#Cross referencing @tbl-Smart_Pill contains a table of the participants based on their group (Critical patient vs Healthy Volunteer) @fig-SmartWGTime is showing the frequency of WG Time

#What is the percentage of Healthy Females 
Female <- inline_text(table1,variable = "sex_cat", level= "Female", column = "Healthy Volunteer")

per <- inline_text(table1,variable = "sex_cat", level= "Male", column = "stat_0",

```

There are (`r Female`) Females and (`r Male`) Males in the healthy volunteer population. The overall amount of Black participants is (`r per`)
